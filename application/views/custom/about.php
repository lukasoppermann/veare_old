				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Vision</h2>
				<p>Every creative process should start with a vision, an idea to strive towards. This idea does not have to be 100% realisable, but it should stay within the realm of realism.</p>
				<p>A vision builds on your business philosophy, creating a direction for the future of your business. This vision should cover all aspects of your business, because they might effect the project even if they do not seem closely related. We will use this vision as our guideline throughout the whole process.</p>

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Intelligent Design</h2>
				<p>Intelligent design is informed decision making based on a future vision and a data-based user analysis. We create modern design solutions based on knowledge about your target users. This means that for each project the focus might be shifted. Some clients want state-of-the-art products that can engage their modern and up to date users, while others need to focus more on raw information and support for legacy browsers.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Modern Branding</h2>
				<p>veare delivers modern branding solutions which adapt as media and devices change.
The hardest part of modern, adaptive design, is to let go of some control. But by allowing for more flexibility we can create a corporate system which works well in all media while being recognisable as one brand. This means it adapts to yet unforeseeable changes, were traditional identities have to be altered or even reinvented.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Web & Interface Design</h2>
				<p>An interface should be driven by information, because information is the single most important part of any application or websites on desktops, tablets or phones.
This is why we focus on the information architecture first. Once the information is structured, an interface is created to allow fast and easy access. 
				</p><p>
As an interface design studio veare aims for usability and performance. Users should focus on what they want to do rather than how to do it. This is why every piece of information has to be easily accessible. By combining good information architecture and an easy to use interface, we deliver an enjoyable user experience.
