				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Vision</h2>
				<p>Every creative process should start with a vision. An idea to strive towards. This idea does not have to be 100% realisable, but it should stay within the realm of realism.</p>
				<p>A vision builds on your business philosophy, creating a direction for the future of your business. This vision should cover all aspects of your business, because they might effect the project even if they do not seem closely related. We will use this vision as our guideline throughout the whole process.</p>

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Intelligent Design</h2>
				<p>Intelligent design is informed decision making based on a future vision and a data-based user analysis. I create modern design solutions based on knowledge about your target users. This means that for each project the focus might be shifted. Some clients want state-of-the-art products that can fascinate their modern and up to date users, while others need to focus more on raw information and support for legacy browsers.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Modern Branding</h2>
				<p>I deliver modern branding solutions which adapt as media and devices change.
The hardest part of modern, adaptive design, is to let go of some control. But by allowing for more flexibility we can create a corporate system which works well in all media while being recognisable as one brand. This means it adapts to yet unforeseeable changes, were traditional identities have to be altered or even reinvented.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Web & Interface Design</h2>
				<p>An interface should be driven by information, because information is the single most important part of any application. This includes websites as well as applications on a desktop or on a phone.
This is why I focus on the information architecture first. Once the information is structured, an interface is created to allow fast and easy access. 
				</p><p>
As an interface designer I optimise for usability and performance. Users should focus on what they want to do rather than how to do it. This is why every piece of information has to be easily accessible. By combining a good information architecture and an easy to use interface, I deliver an enjoyable user experience.

The fast changing world of commerce requires a different approach to branding due to the recent changes including the move towards mobile and the web. Digital media becomes more prominent and important than offline brand experience and therefore the brand has to be integrated deeply into your design to provide a brand experience even without logos and other corporate elements.
