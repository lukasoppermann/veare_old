				<p>Every creative process should start with a vision. An idea to strive towards. You have to know where you want to be in one year, or even ten. This vision does not have to be 100% realisable, but it should stay within the realm of realism.</p>
				<p>A vision should cover all levels of a project, the core idea, the design, the communication, the business aspect and whatever else is part of your business. This will be our guide throughout the project.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Intelligent Design</h2>
				<p>Intelligent design means informed decisions based on a future vision and a data-based user analysis. By making informed design decisions based on knowledge about the target users, I can create modern concepts that are designed to suit the user. This means that for each project the focus might be shifted. Some clients want state-of-the-art products that can fascinate their modern and up to date users, while others need to focus more on raw information and support for legacy browsers.</p>

				<p>By designing flexible corporate identities with a strong emphasis on digital I deliver a modern branding solutions which adapt as media and devices change.</p>
				<p>The hardest part of modern, adaptive design, is to let go of some control. But by going this step one can create a corporate system which works well in all media while being recognisable as one brand.</p>
				<p>In contracts to the traditional corporate identity, a corporate system is flexible, it guides but does not always strictly define the one solution. This means it adapts to yet unforeseeable changes, were traditional identities have to be altered or even reinvented.

				<h2 class="open_sans_bold sub-headline">Web & Interface Design</h2>
				<p>Every interface wether it is on the web, your computer or a phone, is a shell for information. Information is what the users wants to get or submit, this is why I focus on the information architecture first.</p>
				<p>I believe in usability and speed. A slow interface is a bad interface, which is why every element has to be easily accessible according to its importance and frequency of use.
By reducing elements the interface gets easier to use and maintain.</p>

The fast changing world of commerce requires a different approach to branding due to the recent changes including the move towards mobile and the web. Digital media becomes more prominent and important than offline brand experience and therefore the brand has to be integrated deeply into your design to provide a brand experience even without logos and other corporate elements.
