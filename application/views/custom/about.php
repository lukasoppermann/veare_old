				<p>Intelligent design means informed decisions based on a future vision and a data-based user analysis. By making informed design decisions based on knowledge about the target users, I can create modern concepts that are designed to suit the user. This means that for each project the focus might be shifted. Some clients want state-of-the-art products that can fascinate their modern and up to date users, while others need to focus more on raw information and support for legacy browsers.</p>

The fast changing world of commerce requires a different approach to branding due to the recent changes including the move towards mobile and the web. Digital media becomes more prominent and important than offline brand experience and therefore the brand has to be integrated deeply into your design to provide a brand experience even without logos and other corporate elements.
